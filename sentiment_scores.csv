1,1,"Ordered tacos, half way through found a dead lady bug in one and a dead fly in another. Shows they don‚Äôt wash their lettuce properly nor maintain cleanliness. The health inspector needs to pay them a visit"
2,2,"I was probably the first customer of the day and  the service was great (calm, professional, and patient) and the food tastes delicious. As a person who has been a server, I know how hard it is to be 100% setup when you unlock the door-- very impressive!"
3,3,"Place was a mess. I almost took a pic of the bathroom but that would've been unnecessary seeing as how almost every recent review of this place is a 1 or 2 star. Firstly, the guy who made my food the first time I went consistently put more ‚Ä¶"
4,4,This might be the worst chipotle to exist. I‚Äôve never experienced a friendly worker when going inside. Delivery? Forget about it. Your order will be entirely wrong. It‚Äôs apparently too difficult to simply read a receipt and give someone ‚Ä¶
5,5,My family had worst experience at this Chipotle location. Staff is not friendly at all. My toddler want to use rest room on urgent basis & they already closed the rest rooms one hour before the store closing time. They don‚Äôt have any ‚Ä¶

7,7,"Food looks good but I got the smallest potion from any chipotle ever. I actually couldn‚Äôt believe it, the girl serving meat gave me maybe 5 pieces of chicken total. Going to a different location next time"
8,8,"Service was fast and the chicken was good but that was about it. Chips were burned/over cooked, lettuce was on the warm side and didn‚Äôt look the best. Could have been a lot better."
9,9,Good transportation and food. The customer service was terrible. I was standing line and I did not get any service. So I stand in the pick up line and the worker finally saw me when two other customers came in. ‚Ä¶
10,10,AGAIN the fajita vegetables are so overcooked they are totally mush! Also I get attitude from the servers whenever I ask for them to please drain the beans and vegetables before putting them into my bowl. It's supposed to be a burrito bowl ‚Ä¶
11,11,"Understand staffs may have been stretched, but compromising how you serve and handle food is unacceptable. We bought 2 burritos and both are so badly done, before we even pick the food it was leaking, things were out and we could hardly eat ‚Ä¶"
12,12,This company is suing sweetgreen for using the spice Chipotle in its new bowl. Literally never eating here again. Your food isn‚Äôt even healthy! Greedy corrupt corporation.
13,13,First time trying Chipotle and I see what all the uproar is about! I had the bowl with white pinto bean chicken and steak fajita vegetables fresh tomatoe salsa sour cream and cheese everything blended together perfect freash and the meat ‚Ä¶
14,14,Never had the greatest experiences with thus location. I frequent Chipotle often and this might be the worst location on average I've visited. ‚Ä¶
15,15,"It was 9:30pm. They close at 10pm. Restroom is unavailable already. I‚Äôm pregnant and cannot hold it (considering that I live in suburbs). Still no way I could use that restroom.
Thanks a lot üëçüèº ‚Ä¶"
16,16,BATHROOM CODE IS 2580 - REFUSED TO GIVE ME WATER CUP WITH BURRITO
17,17,Always out of ingredients and staff is nonchalant and manager Lorena refused a refund for my order then offers chips (that are always stake) for an order that I decided I did not want.
18,18,Pretty sad they gave me brown lettuce in my Burrito bowl. Lettuce isnt even exspensive. I'm done with this place. Never again. Too many Complaints from this chain. Close the doors in all the ones in Chicago. Terrible presentation. Who wants brown slimy lettuce through out their Burrito bowl
19,19,It gets a little crowded. But the food is good.
20,20,This is my fave chipotle downtown. Nice ppl and know my order which is nice!!
21,21,It's always been very fast even when the line is long.
22,22,"Truly the worst chipotle in existence. They are SO skimpy on literally every ingredient (if they even have all the ingredients there, which they usually don‚Äôt). ‚Ä¶"
23,23,"Patricia was a doll!! Thank you for being so kind and patient, not only with me but all the guests in front of me as well. You guys have the right person working the front ‚ú®"
24,24,Your typical Chipotle with great food that you will love. It does get busy during the week and the seating is pretty limited. Also the past two times I've been in here I have almost slipped on the floor due to rain or snow. They should put ‚Ä¶
25,25,"This is the ideal chipotle. They hook it up and aren‚Äôt busy and they always have everything, unlike most chipotles. Workers are the best!!"
26,26,"This location is a mess. Online orders are frequently late and/or incorrect. Multiple reviews here mention seeing roaches. They have a contactless pickup shelf for the many takeout orders they get but they almost never use it, so all the ‚Ä¶"
27,27,This is the worst chipotle I‚Äôve ever been to hands down. Management is non-existent here. 5th time in a row without chips and waiting on cooked chicken.
28,28,The lady in front of me complained that her rice wasn't done. She had to have them remake it. They never swapped out the old nasty rice and we're going to continue to serve it to future customers.  Apparently they have a homeless problem ‚Ä¶
29,29,"We love Mexican and walked by this spot on Michigan Avenue a number of times. It was a deceptively small window-front and you could see people sitting on stools at the little ""bar"" eating their food while looking out at you on the sidewalk. ‚Ä¶"
30,30,"All burrito bowls were wrong when I ordered online to pickup. The burrito bowls also had very very little amount of lettuce, there was also way too many beans and not enough meat. It was still good, just not how I wanted it because there ‚Ä¶"
31,31,"No problem with the place for grabbing a quick lunch, but today I noticed just how absolutely tastless the burrito was. When got to the gristle taste I actually knew it had steak. No tomato, sour cream, veggies taste at all. I did taste the pop though."
32,32,"My usual chipotle spot. I decided to stop by for a delicious bowl after school today. As I slowly opened the doors to the mediocre sometimes delicious Mexican chain, I was appalled at the sight of an employee filling up the cheese container ‚Ä¶"
33,33,"I have had a handful of normal meals at this Chipotle location. Unfortunately today, I made an online order, and the ""burrito"" that was made for my order was not only completely wrong, but so covered in sour cream (that I did not order), that it was closer to a soup than a burrito."
34,34,"Let me start by saying Chipotle is my favorite fast food chain and I've had hundreds of bowls within the last few years. This location though is very disappointing. I've ate here 3 times and each time the bowls were tasteless, rice was dry ‚Ä¶"
35,35,"Good vibe and helpful staff! I went in to grab an order and deliver it to a customer on my bike. They got my order made exactly how the customer wanted it (and specifically drained the mild salsa for me before it leaked all over the inside of my bag). They got through the line quickly too, which is major points from me!"
36,36,The employees need to be trained on proper sanitation they wear gloves but do a lot of touching other things besides food with gloves like pulling up their mask over their nose when customers comes in...why is it down to begin with? She was ‚Ä¶
37,37,"If you've been to Chipotle, you know what you're getting. This location is a busy, popular spot and the quality has never disappointed. The staff are friendly and helpful. It can get quite crowded during lunch, but the line moves well enough. Convenient if you're in River North or catching the Red Line."
38,38,"My and husband and I were regulars here . Every day I‚Äôd get a steak bowl , until one of their employees Tamara Chandler informed us of their pest problem. She told us they have mice and roaches. We haven‚Äôt been back since . I have strong suggest you don‚Äôt here until they get it under control."
39,39,"If you love burritos you'll love Chipotle.  It has been popping up everywhere in the last few years.  This location has extremely quick service, and since you watch them put together your burrito - it can't be screwed up!  I get a chicken burrito 9/10 times."
40,40,"ü§†üçΩÔ∏è               üåüüåüüåüüåü+
The facility was very clean, the food was fresh, the staff was very friendly and professional. Nice location, close to the subway at Grand and State. the ‚Ä¶"
41,41,I ordered online to pick up at the restaurant. The meal was ready right on time which was nice. But it tastes like it's 2 days old. The rice is HARD and it does not taste warm. I am very unhappy.
42,42,"Rude service,Bad food , Purposely give smaller portions to make people pay double Won‚Äôt give bathroom service code if you wait in line until you pay smh"
43,43,Place was clean. Service was fast and polite. Great food although since it was downtown they did charge an extra dollar more to the menu for example rather than the veggie being $6.50 it was $7.50 which I thought was odd.
44,44,"Staff is horrible. I come here at least once a week since it‚Äôs close by but I‚Äôm never greeted and they are extremely slow. Even when there is no line, staff members are usually checking their phone and gossiping with each other while I was ‚Ä¶"
45,45,"Horrible experience. I placed an online order, wasnt ready when I arrived...took 13 minutes after it was supposed to be ready before I even got my order which was sloppy as ever. I threw it away because the burrito was a mess. Employees were not very inviting. I don't recommend this location"
46,46,"This location was unclean. As soon as i walked in I was greeted with a nasty prep area, the griller worked on top of a nasty prep area and 4 people  passed by it and never cleaned it. I spoke to two managers about it and they stated they ‚Ä¶"
47,47,"I tried to order within Chipotle‚Äôs app twice and both times orders were never delivered! After complaining, Chipotle does nothing to correct the problem nor even try! Qdoba will not be my place to go!"
48,48,"We've been to 2 Chipotles in Chicago on vacation here. Both locations without even having to ask to follow protocol for a gluten allergy have just jumped, fresh bins, separated and completed with a smile. Where we live, that's hard to find ‚Ä¶"
49,49,"I work right near this location. I try to come in often as they make some great food. I ordered a quesadilla today, and the manager comped it because they hadn't seen me for a while! Free food tastes great, but regardless of that, I really enjoy this location and have been enjoying it for years!"
50,50,"This is easily the best Chipotle in Chicago. I work in the area and even though it's always super busy during lunch, my online order is ready when it's supposed to be, and is perfect. This Chipotle is truly the only good thing about working in River North, which is a nightmare hellscape."
51,51,"Nice and spacious. Beautiful window view and the staff are pretty nice, courteous and professional. The food is good, just need a touch more of salt. Other than that, I really don't have any complaints at all."
52,52,"It's chipotle, the staff are chill and made you some tasty food what's not to like"
53,53,Food was fresh but portions .. quarter of a spoon of meat?!! Or of pretty much anything. Beans and rice had no flavor. Scratching this location off the list for sure
54,54,I've been here three times for lunch; quick service every time. It's a small spot but never had trouble finding a place to sit. Generous with the sour creme.
55,55,"I love chipotle in general, this location is great because it's good food for a fantastic price in the middle of the restaurant district of Chicago. NOT impressed with their online ordering... They advertise it like it's a time saver and ‚Ä¶"
56,56,"Ahhhh, Chipotle, we meet again. How I have loved  your chicken burritos for so long. I've recently switched to chicken bowls rather than burritos to save on the carbs. I was afraid I would lose some of the flavor, but none was lost! I love ‚Ä¶"
57,57,"This store has drastically changed within the last two weeks. It's dirty, there are bugs flying out of the plasticware dispenser, and all of the tables have food on them. The last clean table is where some of the staff are randomly hanging out while the few in line are doing the brunt of the work. Never again!"
58,58,You'll have to wait about 10+ minutes during the lunch rush which is when I go. Other than that generous servings compared to the one by my house. Just need to be able to move customers out faster.
59,59,"Mexican grill offering quick options like burritos, tacos, burrito bowls, etc. They used to be my favorite 'go to' spot for burritos but now I usually frequent my neighborhood mom and pop Mexican restaurant. Chipotle is okay if you're ‚Ä¶"
60,60,"Mistakenly ordered a burrito instead of a bowl. When i asked if the bowl could be made instead, the cashier proceeded to insult me with expletives. I've never had such an awful experience and I will not be returning."
61,61,"Chipotle is great.  I never used to eat burritos before a friend introduced me to them here.  Now that ive widened my horizons, ive tried them at lots of places, but chipotle is the only place i keep coming back to.  Its great being able to ‚Ä¶"
62,62,Loveeeee this Chipotle. The food is amazing and not to mention the staff. Always positive and so helpful! I come everyday and never have a single complain. Highly recommend this restaurant!
63,63,"This chipotle sucks! Yes, its possible. just threw out all of my food because the guacamole was old and ruined everything. This isnt a first time so i have to say something. Freaking sucks. I spend $10.04 on food i expect it to be somewhat ‚Ä¶"
64,64,"The place if fast if you in a rush, but still gives great service. It is always filling and I recommend the Bowl!! You can't go wrong with getting the chicken. I also recommend the chips with some sour cream."
65,65,Saw a cockroach in the dining area while in line and walked out. I see a 7 month old review talking about cockroaches as well. Get your roach problem under control.
66,66,"Mom and I had delicious tacos, actually she had a chicken bowl without the tortillas. My tacos were yummy!"
67,67,"Worst service ever! Small portions, rude employee, dirty store! Avoid at all costs"
68,68,Had the smallest portion ever with this Chipotle location. Usually I'm stuffed after a eating a bowl at other locations but not this one. All the tables were unclean. Had to walk around to find a clean table.
69,69,"I love chipotle, but I went to this new location and was surprised by the really bad customer service. The two girls serving the food looked down on customers, and seemed like they were not enjoying their job, and were taking it all out on the customers. Will not go back to this location."
70,70,"Don‚Äôt go to this location they will give you half spoon of everything, including your protein which is the worst.  SMH! Very disappointed, I basically paid $21.5 for 2 half burritos üåØüôÑ ‚Ä¶"
71,71,There were several large pieces of avocado shell in my burrito. See included photo.
72,72,What can I say I just love me some Chipotle got to get that half chicken half steak burrito with fajita mix black beans pico de gallo and a red sauce and lettuce. ‚Ä¶
73,73,"I feel like they're going light on giving you extra ingredients and making the burritos smaller than they used to but it's still really good, fresh food."
74,74,Best Chipotle I have ever been too. The staff seems to enjoy their jobs there. The place is very clean. It's definitely my favorite location.
75,75,Incredible food nice staff
76,76,It's chipotle. What does that mean?  You're going to have a fast delicious tex-mex style meal. You'll leave with a full belly. I'm a big fan of ordering the burrito bowl with tacos on the side (no extra charge).
77,77,"This Chipotle is very similar to the other's in the franchise, but it's the one closest to my work so I frequent it most often.  The burritos are delicious :)  There is often a line during lunch, so be prepared."
78,78,"New smoked brisket is the worst. Dry, hard, tasteless pieces of burnt charcoal. Don't try it."
79,79,"Its chipotle, but it was never busy for marathon weekend and i was in and out without a hiccup."
80,80,"Service sucks at this location but it is otherwise the same old Chipotle food you will get at any other location.  I recommend going to a real Mexican restaurant if you're already downtown but if you have to have Chipotle, this will do."
81,81,"Convenient, fast, clean, and great food! Would have loved more seating, and perhaps something a bit more comfortable as a queue area, but otherwise this is a great place to grab a bite anytime!"
82,82,"They use the grass feed cows' meat!  It was recommended  in Food Inc movie!
Very fast you can pickup your food or dine in and the Mexican food choices are delicious."
83,83,"Like every other River‚Äã North counter service lunch spot, long lines and scarce seating at lunch rush. Otherwise, standard Chipotle conveniently located at the corner of State St. And Grand."
84,84,"The thing about all chipotles is the servers don't listen and ask the same questions over and over. I don't get it, because this is particular to chipotles only. It's almost as if they're in their own world."
85,85,Great location. The staff is super friendly and fast. Really enjoyed it.
86,86,I had an awesome time the staff was friendly and nice the bathrooms were clean and sanitized.....great experience will definitely backüëçüëçüëçthe food was scrumptious as always..... ‚Ä¶
87,87,"I love chipotle, I don't love this location. You basically get a rice burrito. Walk an extra few blocks to the one on Michigan. Much better"
88,88,"Server gave different amounts of meat to different customers, chicken was burnt. Other than that, service was fast and nice."
89,89,"Been to this location multiple times. Hard, uncooked rice, smaller serving sizes than other locations, and occasional bad service are among the reasons I will never return here."
90,90,I don't understand how this restaurant franchise stays open for business. The food nasty and environment preparation area is full of germs/contamination.
91,91,Girl that took my order seemed to be annoyed the whole time and didn‚Äôt give me the proper amount of food. I asked for more rice and that seemed to bother her...
92,92,Every time I go there the food is looking dry up why can't you stir the food make it presentable I walk out every time and go to Chipotle on state
93,93,They need to start hiring people who actually care for their customers. They need to loose their attitudes before walking in for their shift. Makes customers uncomfortable.
94,94,If you order a large guacamole with a large bag of chips make sure they don‚Äôt give you a regular bag of chips. They keep making the same mistake.
95,95,Their food is wonderful.I love how they mix there foods together. Their service is unbelievable .When you eat their food it gives you that mexican feel about food.
96,96,"How mych do I lover thee, let me count the ways, love those burrito bowls, steak, yummy goodness in a bowl, thats rocks, you can add the vegiies and cheese and salsa, it never ends, I became addicted to the stuff during pregnancy and it stayed with me"
97,97,Your average Chipotle. One thing that is annoying is that this place always breaks (when folding it they pop it) my burrito unlike other Chipotles that I visit.
98,98,"Quick, filling, great food - team is more than happy to help you choose the best dish from their menu"
99,99,"The food at this location is the same as the other chipotle branches, yet I have had repeated occurrences with rude staff and unethical behavior at this location, I reccomend walking to the other downtown locations."
100,100,"Been here multiple times, usually packed, but when I came in to pick up an online order, there was no one in line, yet took 15 minutes to get someone's attention and my order hadn't been started."
101,101,Found four small pieces of bones in my food. Felt severe discomfort while chewing the food. I am a regular customer but this was very bad experience.
102,102,"The food was good, but my son couldn't get in the bathroom even with the secret code."
103,103,"Never been to this location, live the Brand and the Food. The location is good for in and out parking for downtown."
104,104,"First time I had Chipotle, Belgian guy in Chicago, was great, I enjoyed it for like 3 days."
105,105,"It's clean inside, but compared to other chiptole locations in the city, the staff here are... ""Slightly less competent"" you could say. Not for folks in a hurry"
106,106,"Chipotle is definitely the best restaurant of its kind in terms of serving fresh, tasty, well-portioned, responsibly sourced food"
107,107,"Five stars for being exactly what you'd expect from any Chipotle. Despite its downtown location, the prices are still the same as anywhere else."
108,108,Good food at decent prices. Can get a little noisy around lunch and very busy.
109,109,"It's alright,  tolerable. If I want real Mexican food I wouldn't eat at Chipotle"
110,110,It's Chipotle.. Same great food and large portions at a great price.  You know I'll be back
111,111,Staff was friendly. Everything was clean. Bathrooms were clean. Food was great! It was good times!
112,112,Made fresh daily you can taste the hard work that goes into each meal üòÅ‚ù§üëç ‚Ä¶
113,113,"Serving & wrapping is little different than what I used have in Toronto, Canada. Overall it is ok."
114,114,Waited +8 minutes than scheduled could order in person quicker
115,115,I love Chipolte! Food is always fresh. Dont rush the people thru the line tho'.
116,116,"Don't get the brisket, they give you less than half of a scoop"
117,117,"Great food and great service!  Delivery was early, driver was communicative and courteous!"
118,118,"Usual Chipotle. Frequently the service is very, very slow. Food is just as great as any other Chipotle though."
119,119,What's the point of having rewards app to scan off I'm just told that I have to manually enter it from the receipt. #chipotlefail
120,120,The store manager literally yelled at me like I was her kid lol üòÇ ‚Ä¶
121,121,"I love this place for clean eating, I go there for the chicken bowls, delicious!"
122,122,"Worst Chipotle in the City. Super small portion sizes, rude, very unhelpful staff."
123,123,Never give enough meat and charge so much for extra but it's good
124,124,"Food are fresh served but while I'm in queue for order, the sewer pipes are smelling badly."
125,125,"Line can be a little long at this location but other than that, it's just as great as all other locations."
126,126,Fast service. It's ok. They need to add sour cream to their quesadillas.
127,127,Ate here twice. Got food poisoning twice. If I could give no stars I would.
128,128,"Called to place an order to go - at 3pm when I know they're not busy - and they told me to ""place the order online"". #lazy"
129,129,"It's Chipotle, it's fast and used to be cheap, not anymore"
130,130,Really good and a good price.   I love the hard shell tacos.   Try them.
131,131,Food was good.
132,132,About as good as you'd expect from a Chipotle!
133,133,Awful food and service. Really just horrible.
134,134,Service here is always excellent and I always have a great time seeing Sherie
135,135,"Move quick, seating is limited but people dont tend to linger"
136,136,I like chipotle but this location make me fall in love with it.Just perfect :)
137,137,"It's the same as every other Chipotle, and that's why we love it."
138,138,chipotle is absolutely incredibly amazing if you have free burrito coupon.
139,139,Didn‚Äôt give me silverware or napkins with online order.
140,140,i like going here cuz it a mexican restaurant and im mexican american and it has the burritos i like the burrito bowl i recomended to you.

142,142,They take care of long lines quickly! Staff is upbeat too
143,143,Is what it is for a good chain choice. Fresh cooked and staff is as expected.
144,144,Best place for an American style burrito with a cheap price! üëåüèª ‚Ä¶
145,145,One of the best Mexican food and you can find it everywhere
146,146,burritos that make you turn your head too the side are so good.
147,147,Missed chipotle a lot! Huge amount of delicious burrito with reasonable price!
148,148,They were rude and gave me one million beans when I said no beans.
149,149,"Love the staff there, their awesome and always so accommodating!!!"
150,150,Better than the loop one. Much cleaner and spacious.
151,151,"It's same as indian dish, still needs spicy"
152,152,Was ok but mild needs to be less spice that is more medium
153,153,Great service! They're They're friendly!
154,154,Great food with a good price politic :)
155,155,"quick easy, don't stay hungry grab a burrito on the go!"

159,159,Good food. Nice portions
160,160,Best food I have ate in USA....
161,161,Super clean. Super fast. Excellent service!

401,401,Looks like all new crew... They are not welcoming. Serve cold meat and cold rice. Rush you. Give you half of what you used to get. Forget what you want on your bowl. Used to come here but won't anymore.
402,402,I ordered a veggie bowl and just wanted the included free guacamole on the side. I do this through the app fine. I asked in person and they charged me for the guac and acted really rude when I asked for clarification on why I was being charged for guac on a veggie bowl.
403,403,"Customer Service was TERRIBLE. DO NOT GO HERE. Whoever Is Over the Staff that was there on June 5th @ 6:00 PM. Should do an ENTIRE RESWAP of the staff IMMEDIATELY. That entire staff is going to ruin the revenue coming into your company, i ‚Ä¶"
404,404,This chipotle is disgusting. They are sloppy and unsanitary. I had to walk out while the girl was fixing my food because she picked up the corn that fell and put it back in my bowl!!! You will have to see the way they operate to believe it. ü§Æü§¢ ‚Ä¶
405,405,"The worst branch ever. They gave me an order I think doesn't belong to me, the add-ons were different. Additionally, the portion size wasn‚Äôt good enough"
406,406,"I go to chipotle frequently and this time was the worst ever, no joke. Look at the pictures. We had a party and I ordered 4 entrees for 4 people. Party was over really quick. All 4 spent evening sh**ing themselves. The guacamole colour says it all with over burnt meat."
407,407,"This location did not have many of the ingredients (like beans, white rice, etc) 45 minutes before closing time. It seemed like they closed their kitchen and stopped making food an hour before closing. When telling the employees that they ‚Ä¶"
408,408,The people that work there are TERRIBLE. I say avoid this place at ALL cost. Hopefully they shut down soon. All the food is spoiled. They don‚Äôt know how to follow directions and it seems the manager don‚Äôt care at all. They just need to put a parking lot there at this point. Also don‚Äôt transfer none of them to another store.
409,409,"The location is quite convenient. It is just next to the Grand Station Red Line.  Very nice and bright place, cheerful customer service, tried their chicken burrito and the burrito bowl both tastes great! The corn chip was a blast!"
410,410,Reviewing after multiple poor experiences here. Pick up order is always either cold (even though I arrive early) or flat out wrong. Couldn‚Äôt get over my ‚Äúcheese quesadilla‚Äù today and had to post
411,411,"I had the nastiest bowl here. The lettuce was old, beans had so much water. I looked like a soup and the sour cream got mixed with the water. The employees were very rude, SHE SAID SHE COULD‚ÄôNT DIDNT WANT TO SELL ME A SINGLE TACO."
412,412,Disgusting. My bowl reaked of rotten ingredients before I opened the bag and sure enough rotten dairy odor and nearly black guac. Clearly no care for their patrons.
413,413,"This location is terrible. They give you anything when you do a pickup order. If you wait in line, they give the smallest portion size, barely any meat and not even a tablespoon of guacamole for the extra $3. Ridiculous!"
414,414,I eat Chipotle at several locations mostly on North side and I know what it should taste like as I always get the same meal. This location good was gross and is uneatable. The staff also did not properly close my steak bowl and on the walk ‚Ä¶
415,415,Paid for double steak received at best a half portion. Never going back. Chipotle corp didn‚Äôt seem to care either. If I could give negative stars I would.
416,416,"I will never patronize this place again they are nasty. Me and a coworker witness one of the cooks, drop the spatula on the floor and picked it up and continue to use it to cook with.  We asked him was he gonna clean it off and he ignored us and continue to work like he didn‚Äôt hear  us. Disgusting!!!"
417,417,"Not going to lie. The Entire Staff That Is On Shift Monday June 5th, 2023, At 6:30PM-7:00PM were DISGUSTINGLY RUDE AND INAPPROPRIATE. I‚Äôm calling cooperate. The staff refused to serve me and threaten to spit in my food."
418,418,"I‚Äôd give a zero if possible. Never order from this chipotle, ever. I ordered twice in a row because the first time I got the wrong order completely (chicken bowl with all the wrong toppings instead of a veggie bowl. Reordered my veggie ‚Ä¶"

420,420,Standard Chipotle experience with fast service and overall clean atmosphere. Large lunch rush from local office buildings. Lots of to-go traffic.
421,421,"This is the only chipotle in the area but by far the worst chipotle I‚Äôve been to. I‚Äôve worked at chipotle in the past for 6 months, I understand how portions work and they give an insanely low amount of portions, less than what they‚Äôre ‚Ä¶"
422,422,"Terrible customer service, when ordering online food is never ready when app indicates it is. Food is usually undercook. Would not recommend."
423,423,Worst chipotle ever.  Got 4 delivery orders in a row wrong.  Idiots.
424,424,This restaurant is so petty they threw a bag a me and I had to calm myself down so never go here
425,425,Went here today and the nicest employee took my order. Then as i was eating maybe 15+ min later i overheard the manager harassing her about checking her phone for less than 5 seconds. I overheard them argue and she tried to send her home. ‚Ä¶
426,426,"Just had a horrible experience with a woman named Lucille, who said she was the manager. I shop here all the time and never had any issues. I was pointing through the glass at toppings that I wanted, and she, very rudely yelled, ‚Äúcan you ‚Ä¶"
427,427,I ordered a veggie bowl and the vegetables were burnt (not roasted) ....and the white rice was not cooked well. I had a bunch of raw rice grains in my bowl.
428,428,DISGUSTING location 525 Monroe. I could smell the rotting food before I even opened the bag and sure enough rotting dairy and guac that was almost black. It is very clear employees have zero concern for consumer safety. Absolutely filthy!!!
429,429,"The staff is rude & portions low.
They reccomended going to other locations when i brought this up so I reccomend the same thing."
430,430,Service is super quick but because of it can be rude or just not helpful. Food was good
431,431,"How can it be that hard to get a 2 person order correct?  Made 3 orders from here in 6 months, 2 were badly wrong.  First one had everything basically wrong.  Today, ordered a steak burrito with extra steak and got no steak at all on the ‚Ä¶"
432,432,Great Chipotle location. The staff moves quick through the downtown lunch rush. As a Chipotle connoisseur I can say with confidence that location has the best steak. They season it well!
433,433,"Good food, great price. Let's come to test."
434,434,"Ordered their new plant based chorizo for delivery, and was instead given chicken. As a vegan, this is unacceptable. I called and asked for them to correct the order, and they said they couldn't deliver it since it was delivered by a third ‚Ä¶"
435,435,I‚Äôve been here maybe two dozen times and been to plenty of other Chipotle locations. This location is horrendous about skimping on the portions compared to others. Avoid mobile ordering at all costs. I think everyone that works here is a 90 lb teenager that doesn‚Äôt understand what a normal portion from Chipotle looks like.
436,436,"Worst location in Chicago. I go to chipotle regularly and this location always skimps on portions, try to move faster than their brains work, and don‚Äôt know basic manners. How many people does it take to make a burrito bowl? Truly awful"
437,437,"My burrito was all tortilla and they didn‚Äôt even put sofritas, don‚Äôt get this chipotle"
438,438,Met expectations.  Great service and  clean.  Definitely would go back.
439,439,I love everything here! The burritos and salads are my favorite!!! & there‚Äôs always leftovers for later. Thanks for great service.
440,440,Not friendly attitudes. Doesn‚Äôt have good customer service. They don‚Äôt say thank you. And Food had onions in it I did not order and beans using same utensils
441,441,Last time I came here had the worst experience went on a 6 month boycott finally broke down and came back. Once again the experience was horrible why can they not fill the bottom of the bowl. If that is the correct amount then change the ‚Ä¶
442,442,Food was excellent with the exception of the steak being over cooked. The restaurant was clean. The staff was constantly cleaning the floor. They checked to make sure that I was satisfied with my purchase.
443,443,"This particular location is subpar in both service and quality of food. Chipotle in general is good at different locations, except this one! They literally served me and 4 other individuals cold food. When we brought it back to them within ‚Ä¶"
444,444,"What's great about this place is their speed, quality and consistency. Few fast food places can come close. They have mastered the good/fast/cheap balance. Now they just need a better line management process so people don't clog the turnstile waiting. The order in advance helps a lot with that."
445,445,Always the skimpiest portions. Like thanks for the 5 shreds of lettuce‚Ä¶
446,446,I am a loyal Chipotle fan & I absolutely LOVE the food. The service is extremely fast. I like to go here because it's fast & affordable. The portion sizes are HUGE and it's enough to feed two people. Love the atmosphere and the music. I'm never disappointed when I come here.
447,447,Great food!!!! Great service‚Ä¶ management needs to make sure all employees are working and not on their phones during the rush. Employees should take the phone call off the line!!! No tik toks where customers can see youüëéü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ‚Ä¶
448,448,"I love this Chipotle!  Food is always fresh!  Staff is always great, particularly Juanita!  Throughout my pregnancy,  I've been eating Chipotle.  She always checked in on how me and the baby were doing. Made me feel welcomed and special =)"
449,449,"Did an online order & Order was all wrong , they remade it & got it wrong a 2nd time! Chips were stale & guacamole was old. Absolutely won't be back to that location."
450,450,"Love this location, food, and service here. The professionals here are excellent. ‚Ä¶"
451,451,"Service was great, but holy sweet Jesus the food was bad. I‚Äôve only been to chipotle a few times before this, and every other time the food has been pretty good. There was a literal TWIG in my burrito. Why? How? I don‚Äôt even want to know. ‚Ä¶"
452,452,"This place is good, however for someone who used to work for chipotle I don't feel the 13 characteristics. I feel that the some workers there don't even want to be there. No greeting, no enthusiasm.  I get it, probably didn't have a good ‚Ä¶"
453,453,"Food was disgusting! chicken extremely salty! Tasted kind of old. employee was very rushy! it was 3:00 in the day, no one was in there... i feel like that is the time where you should be able to provide the best costumer service. I love chipotle, i eat it 3 times a week, but i will never return to this one again."
454,454,"Tried the Chipotle Mexican Grill bowl, double white rice, double chicken, no beans, red salsa, double lettuce, pico de gallo, cheese
and guac. So fresh, clean and delicious. Great interaction with staff. Would highly recommend this Chipotle location."
455,455,"I wold recommend that you come early or later than the lunch hour if you choose to eat here. The line can get very long at noon, stretches out the door. I enjoy eating lunch here because the food is always fresh, and I can get exactly what ‚Ä¶"
456,456,"This restaurant receives the highest marks I can give a Chipotle.  There was a huge line when I stopped here for lunch.  However, the staff was FAST and there was less of a wait than others I had been to with shorter lines.  And the food was as good as Chipotle offers.  I wish the whole chain operated this way."
457,457,I don't understand how anyone can think this is good food. Service was fine but the way they make the burrito makes no sense. First off the whole thing is cold- you have to make a burrito and then let it sit on the grill when it's done so ‚Ä¶
458,458,"I visit this location about once a week, and it's safe to say that I haven't had a properly wrapped burrito in several months. Another manager needs to come to this location as a secret shopper and see what I'm talking about. I get ripped ‚Ä¶"
459,459,Ordering at this Chipotle should be an Olympic sport considering how fast you need to decide on what you want. This is going to sound like a good thing but it‚Äôs not. The ordering process is too fast. I don‚Äôt even have time to think about ‚Ä¶
460,460,I really like chipotle but this location is not patronized well due to staff poor attitude don't come to this location
461,461,Love this place. Very spacious. Plenty of space to sit. Very courteous staff and generous with the portions which I absolutely love! Margaritas are the bomb! My favorite location downtown Chicago. I've never seen it too crowded so I get my food faster than at other locations.
462,462,"My go-to spot for a ""later"" dinner option in my neighborhood when I am too tired too cook and do not want to pay for delivery.  Professional, fast, and good quality. You can regularly see people actually cleaning their kitchen and cooking ‚Ä¶"
463,463,"Located across from Union Station this is a great option for quick bite. Their service is good and friendly.
As per the law they will check for vaccination proof."
464,464,This place is horrible. Dirty ... Everyone is unhappy. Never smiling and rude. Most managers aren't serious.. They need to lead by example. They get an attitude when I ask for plain rice. I don't understand. I love the cashier Rihanna she's the best! Fire everyone else
465,465,"This was my first time in Chipotle, They helped me out with my order. The food was very good. This place was clean.  Will definitely start going to Chipotle. Oh, they gave us free large drink for being a first timer!!! Thank you so much!!!"
466,466,My experiences at all chipotles have been wonderful including ones out of the state. This location is one that I have had the most trouble with. I came here once and there were fruit flies all over the place I tried to eat my food ‚Ä¶
467,467,The staff was exceptional as always but even more so last night. They close at 9pm. It's 8:54 and they still served us with a smile and gratitude. We know the staff wanted to leave. There was no hesitation on their part. Thank you!
468,468,This is well ran establishment. It's extremely clean and the food was delicious. I came at the end of the night and the quality of food was still great. A man by the name of Kemon James completed my order and he was very professional; his staff as well.
469,469,"One of the best Chipotles in the area! Every once in a while, they will skimp on the meat or rice, but never have a problem adding extra if you ask them. Lines are out the door during lunch hours, but its better than crossing the river for the other location"
470,470,"This location chose me a highly qualified man, for an interview. I knew just by the end of my interview that i would not recieve a call back. The interviewer focused more on my hair than the facts i knew of the restaurant to even consider ‚Ä¶"
471,471,Terrible Sevice. I tell them I'm there for a Order. The Lady at Cashier states look to see if it's on Table. I tell her No. Another Gentemen Next to her comes over and Looks. He then states it will be a Few Minutes. 25 Minutes Later I ‚Ä¶
472,472,The food is good beac auw you watch them make it but Don't go during rush hour ! They rush to make your food and the customer service is not good. I went during rush hour at 12p and they made my food the way they wanted too  ! I wanted ‚Ä¶
473,473,"Picked up our order and observed that the person preparing the food wears his mask below the nose (""Nose slinger""). Chipotle should take better care of enforcement of standards."
474,474,It's Chipotle so the food is generally ok. Provided they wrap your burrito correctly. I don't come here often but I've had a couple disintegrate in my hands. The line gets ridiculous during lunch hour though. I stopped coming here because of that and the ecoli issue.
475,475,"The food is good, the one thing I really don't like is that the portions are never correct.  They always under serve the beans and meat!  They don't fill the spoon all the way.  They are too quick which causes errors."
476,476,"Tasty and consistent fresh food. My favorite: a burrito bowl with brown rice, black beans, carnitas, and guac on top."
477,477,"In June 2018 I visited Chicago and had lunch over here with my nephew, both of us vomited badly. that's first time vomitting in 5 years and I fainted lying down on airplane floor. I consider myself very healthy and I complained to Chipotle ‚Ä¶"
478,478,"Fast and friendly service. As expected of Chipotle, the bowls are always good, the Queso and Guacamole are always fresh üòã ‚Ä¶"
479,479,Good service and friendly staff. The place gets really crowded during lunch and the lines are really long. The location seems to be out of key ingredients even during lean hours sometimes making the wait longer.
480,480,"Good food but they work so fast they are very skimpy with everything, my bowl was avouthalf full while other peoples with the same ingredients were much more full. Then they murder it with lettuce, I'd like some chipotle with my lettuce please, otherwise the people are nice."
481,481,"A bit pricier than other Chipotles I've been to, but this place is by far the tastiest. Some Chipotles skimp on portion size, and others are fairly generous. This Chipotle is somewhere between just right and generous."
482,482,"Service was great, food was delicious and ambiance was cute & romantic. The server was very nice, gave us bruschetta while we wait for the food and strawberry panna cotta for dessert (which were both really good). ‚Ä¶"
483,483,The staff here was very helpful and customer friendly and the food is good just like other Chipotles that I have been to
484,484,"Good food. Order ahead to skip the long line at lunch time. Their guacamole is okay, but expensive so I buy the individual serving type from my grocery store."
485,485,This place is consistent. Flavors are always as expected. Service is fast and staff is friendly. Chipotle is awesome because it has veggie and vegan options.
486,486,"This location just cannot get the rice right. Been here a bunch and 9/10 times it's too clumpy/moist, horribly over salted, or trash for other reasons. This is always during lunch rush so not like it's been sitting around."
487,487,Rude when I asked for plain tomatoes instead of salsa. No one felt like cutting it it out thru a machine. After talking to the general manager they just gave me a whole tomato instead. My burrito was getting cold as this took almost 10 minutes to sort out.
488,488,"Usually love going to this location, visited 45 minutes before closing time today and they were already locking up the doors and then said they were out of rice and refused to make more. Kinda sucks they‚Äôre one of the few open food places in the west side of the loop at this time and definitely the only healthier option."
489,489,"Always love the veggie burrito. The spicy salsa, cilantro rice cannot be replicated anywhere else. The chips and guacamole are also consistent. Hands down best taste for a veggie burrito."
490,490,"This Chipolte is pretty consistent, always a line- but they move you thru the line quickly.  The restaurant is always clean, I do wish they would pay more attention to their ice tea brewing- because in the evenings its always out and they ‚Ä¶"
491,491,"We ordered take out from here literally right before they closed, and everything was still prepared really well and with care. Appreciate it!"
492,492,"service was rude and very very very very stingy on what you pay 4, worst chipotle in Chicago ,they give you attitude if you ask for a decent amount of a portion, isn't the whole gimmick is that you get large portions of what you want at ‚Ä¶"
493,493,"My fianc√© came to visit me in Chicago from Vancouver. On July 23, 2017, before we went to board our train, she ate Chipotle Mexican Grill at the location on 525 W Monroe St L1A, Chicago, IL 60661 and became ill a few hours later. ‚Ä¶"
494,494,"Excellent, healthy food. One burrito is perfect for a heavy lunch.
At $10(buritto+soda+taxes), its bit expensive, but considering the high quality meat used-its decent price only."
495,495,"Picked up an online order, only to realize at home that they gave me something completely different. One mess up is okay, but two orders being totally not even close to what I ordered is an issue."
496,496,"I like Chipotle, they don't serve authentic mexican but the amount they serve is totally filling. So worth it. I mostly prefer the rice bowl with chicken and the fried veggies is awesome."
497,497,"Do yourself a favor and walk the extra distance to another location. Employees will touch doors and other objects with the same gloves they handle your food with. They also don‚Äôt understand proper portion sizes, especially when you pay for extra."
498,498,"I'm pretty certain Chipotle puts crack in their food - I mean, I don't know how else to explain this addiction I have for their food.  Insane - I try to only go once a week but I'm a weak weak man.  Guac is a must here - get the bowl and have a party....in your mouth"
499,499,"Wasnt really feeling the way the employee handled my order. Very stingy with the rice,  Im not a kid!"
500,500,Rice was half cooked.  I went for replacement and I still got the same half  cooked rice in the bowl.
501,501,Very convenient place in every way.Surely will come back again
502,502,"Great place to grab a quick bite of protein rich food...a healthier option compared to other junk food items and much better in taste..bowls, burritos, salads are amongst the options on offer to be customized.."
503,503,It has a nice atmosphere later in the evenings after 6.  But I was recently disturbed when I notice some of their employees smoking pot on the south east part of the building behind the Panda express restaurant in broad daylight.
504,504,"The night manager there on Friday July 9th was super sweet and kind.
Great service, clean and accessable."
505,505,This location was okay. The Employees seem like they didn't really wanna be there. But hey ppl should pick their Careers better...
506,506,bad service they change 3 severs to prepare my order
507,507,"Glad they were still open, staff's energy was still very upbeat and polite. Food was delish."
508,508,Really appreciate the workers here. They are always working so hard and yet treat me like fimily. The food is always fresh and ready
509,509,they inadvertently mix the beef with other meet. if you order veggie be ready to get meat.
510,510,Food prep area was a disaster
511,511,"Friendly staff, it's literally Chipotle idk what else you'd expect. Their new briskets option is pretty good though."
512,512,"Awesome staff, I go here 3x a week and it's always great."
513,513,Take advantage of online ordering during weekday lunch rush. Food is the same you will get at any Chipotle location but the staff is quick and friendly.
514,514,Freshest and most delicious chicken 1/2 barbacoa burrito I've had in a while from chiptole! This store rocks! Keep it up!
515,515,"They were rude, didn‚Äôt give enough ingredients and showed no care when putting my order together."
516,516,"Great food and they're very fast. People complain about the line, but they move through it very quickly. It is just a very popular location."
517,517,"Management are awful, rude, and harass their workers. Sad really"
518,518,Staff went above and beyond to cater our office lunch! Great management. Food was fantastic.
519,519,"Place is on point! They always have fresh food, they never run out of supplies, and there staff is friendly!"
520,520,I just ordered a burrito on Uber East from here at 4 pm whoever is in that kitchen seasoning this meat bless you it was the best flavorful burrito I‚Äôve had from chipotle üòãüòã ‚Ä¶
521,521,I like Chipotle! Only issue is that they put a lot of cold items in lukewarm meats and the whole burrito is then lukewarm.  A microwave to heat up the burrito would be great.
522,522,"The food is great, but the line moves very very slowly, even moreso than other locations in the city."
523,523,"Great portions, super fast, professional staff"
524,524,The burritos and tacos are their prominent servings. Decent for it's size. Tacos are really cheap for a quick snack..
525,525,Quick service. Good food. No issues.
526,526,Good service but if you're going for lunch here there's a lot better options that won't require you to stand in the line of finance bros.
527,527,"always the best, organic foods. Best Mexican food on the go around - had to write a review for the Chipolte guys! Fast, friendly, organic!"
528,528,Delicious food love their pork carnitas rice bowl or salad bowl.  Decent price.
529,529,They are fast!  Food was great.  Restroom was clean.
530,530,they made my burrito in under a minute these guys are mad impressive
531,531,"Much smaller portion sizes than every other chipotle I‚Äôve been to. Consistently, every time"
532,532,Love me some.chipotle.  the ala carte tacos are my favorite as three is too much but two is just right.
533,533,"The food is always good, but the serving size varies order by order."
534,534,"Friendly staff, food was made quickly and correctly."
535,535,"Probably the most efficient chipotle in the world
Clears lines of 40+ people in lunch rushes in minutes ‚Ä¶"
536,536,"Decent Chipotle location, quick lunch service despite long lines. Are reasonable with meat and guac portions."
537,537,"Ran out of chicken and rice at the same time, didnt start making it until it was pretty much out....waited 20 min when i was one of the only people there"
538,538,"The service, food and workers were all great. I recommend anyone go there."
539,539,As always at Chipotle: great food for an affordable price. This Chipotle was very clean and not crowded.
540,540,Its just low quality
541,541,"Burrito was not well made and fell apart, carnitas was straight up unseasoned"
542,542,It seems like Chipotle is going down hill. I just don't think the food is as high quality as it used to be.
543,543,Food is ok and can be better when compared to other chipotle restaurants
544,544,"It's a Chipotle...it's as good as Chipotle can be.  That being said, I had a great meal here."
545,545,Terrible customer service
546,546,"We came in with a group of 20 people and they served us all in less than ten minutes, you win chipotle"
547,547,"Food was good and portions were ample.  However, bathrooms were closed."
548,548,Always have a pleasant time here but avoid the noon rush of all the loop workers getting lunch.
549,549,No salsa was included just extra sour cream for app order.
550,550,"If you get a burrito bowl and two tortillas you get more food for the same price, 10/10 would recommend"
551,551,"First time eating there, i asked for a suggestion and was given a shrug, bought the food and later thru it out"
552,552,Quick and friendly service; clean and welcoming atmosphere.
553,553,"This team is kind, fast, and delivers great food!  My first choice for lunch."
554,554,It's good if u like oil free ad no spicy food
555,555,Pretty good location. They get slammed at lunch but the line moves fast.

557,557,"Chipotle is always good, but the staff are always in a rush and don't always listen to what you ask for."
